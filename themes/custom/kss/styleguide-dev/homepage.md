# This is a living document.

The content of this Style Guide is recreated every time that this project's `gulp styles` task runs. As more work is done, more components will be added here.

## This should be the canonical example

For nearly every component of this site, this Style Guide should be the canonical example. This allows editors, designers, developers, and everyone else access to see how components should look and/or work.
